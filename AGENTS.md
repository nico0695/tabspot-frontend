# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

You are a development assistant with access to `sdd-lite`, a structured change workflow for bounded repo changes.

## When to use sdd-lite

Use the `sdd-lite` orchestrator (canonical contract at `sdd-lite/orchestrator/SDDL-ORCHESTRATOR.md`) when one of these is true:

- The user explicitly mentions sdd-lite: "use sdd", "con sdd-lite", "con sdd", "sddl", "hacerlo con sdd", or similar
- The user is starting a feature, refactor, or fix and seems uncertain about scope or approach
- The task spans multiple files, has unclear acceptance criteria, or carries non-trivial risk

Do NOT activate sdd-lite automatically for:

- Simple questions or explanations
- Quick one-line fixes the user clearly understands
- Conversational or exploratory requests

## When to suggest sdd-lite (without forcing it)

If a task looks substantial (new feature, broad refactor, bug with unknown root cause, multi-step change) and the user has not asked for structure, you may briefly offer:

> "This looks like a task where sdd-lite could help with structured planning. Want to use it, or should I proceed directly?"

If the user declines or ignores the suggestion, proceed without sdd-lite.

## When sdd-lite is active

Use the canonical orchestration contract at `sdd-lite/orchestrator/SDDL-ORCHESTRATOR.md` as the source of truth.
Use canonical skills under `sdd-lite/skills/`, runtime standards at `./sdd-lite/skill-catalog.md`, and schemas under `sdd-lite/schemas/`.

Rules:
- Run bootstrap preflight first. If bootstrap files are missing or unusable, stop and run `sddl-init`.
- Keep the orchestrator thin. Prefer reading only `./sdd-lite/openspec/config.yaml`, `./sdd-lite/user-prefs.yaml` (when present), `state.yaml`, `./sdd-lite/skill-catalog.md`, and artifact digests before choosing the next step.
- Recover context from persisted artifacts before asking the user for missing facts.
- Preserve checkpoints, approvals, resume behavior, and lifecycle semantics from the canonical contracts.
- Persisted artifacts must remain in English. Chat interaction may be `es` or `en`.
- Treat `./sdd-lite/skill-catalog.md` as the runtime standards registry. Reuse its compact rules instead of rediscovering project conventions in every stage.

## Delegation Policy

Default to fresh-worker delegation for real stage work.

- Inline only local routing decisions that need at most 3 repo files.
- Delegate to `sddl-deep-explorer` when routing or planning needs 4 or more files, or when a bounded unknown blocks the next safe step.
- Delegate `sddl-proposal-spec`, `sddl-design-plan`, `sddl-executor`, and `sddl-qa-review` as fresh workers by default.
- Do not perform multi-file edits inline in the orchestrator.
- Do not perform builds, installs, test suites, or broad validation inline in the orchestrator.
- Do not delegate per file; delegate per phase or per approved execution stage.

## Delegation Envelope

When launching a stage worker, pass a compact handoff:

- stage id
- `change_name`, objective, and selected route
- approved scope or blocked question
- artifact paths, not large artifact bodies
- short artifact digests
- `## Project Standards (auto-resolved)` copied from `./sdd-lite/skill-catalog.md`
- `## User Preferences (auto-resolved)` derived from `./sdd-lite/user-prefs.yaml` — relevant knobs for the target stage plus matching free rules; omit when the file is absent
- expected result fields: `status`, `executive_summary`, `artifacts`, `next_action`, `open_risks`

Do not paste the full README or broad repo summaries into each worker unless recovery truly requires it.
